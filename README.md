# 蔵 (Kura)

蔵 is the next evolution of my previous RDBMS project, [お箱](https://github.com/ue-sho/ohako). While "お箱" represented a "box," 蔵 reflects the idea of a "warehouse." The goal of this project is to create a simple, yet functional, database management system from scratch in Python. The implementation is based on the SimpleDB of the book "[Database Design and Implementation](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-33836-7)". The original code of SimpleDB is written in Java and can be found [here](http://www.cs.bc.edu/~sciore/simpledb/).
