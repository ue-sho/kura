# è”µ (Kura)

The goal of this project is to create a simple, yet functional, database management system from scratch in Kotlin. The implementation is based on the SimpleDB of the book "[Database Design and Implementation](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-33836-7)". The original code of SimpleDB is written in Java and can be found [here](http://www.cs.bc.edu/~sciore/simpledb/).
